          Este artigo irá ajudá-lo a superar uma das maiores dificuldades que você enfrentará ao tentar acelerar
          o aprendizado: formular conhecimento. A velocidade do aprendizado dependerá da maneira como você formula
          o material. O mesmo material pode ser aprendido muitas vezes mais rápido se bem formulado! A diferença
          de velocidade pode ser impressionante! As regras estão listadas na ordem de importância.

              <p><strong>As 20 regras de formulação de conhecimento na aprendizagem </strong></p>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Do not learn if you do not understand</strong><br>Trying to learn things you do not
                  understand may seem like an utmost nonsense. Still, an amazing proportion of students commit the
                  offence of learning without comprehension. Very often they have no other choice! The quality of many
                  textbooks or lecture scripts is deplorable while examination deadlines are unmovable.If you are not a
                  speaker of German, it is still possible to learn a history textbook in German. The book can be crammed
                  word for word. However, the time needed for such &#8220;blind learning&#8221; is astronomical. Even
                  more important: The value of such knowledge is negligible. If you cram a German book on history, you
                  will still know nothing of history.The German history book example is an extreme. However, the
                  materials you learn may often seem well structured and you may tend to blame yourself for lack of
                  comprehension. Soon you may pollute your learning process with a great deal of useless material that
                  treacherously makes you believe &#8220;it will be useful some day&#8221;. &nbsp;<br></li>
                <li><strong>Learn before you memorize</strong><br>Before you proceed with memorizing individual facts
                  and rules, you need to&nbsp;<strong>build an overall picture of the learned knowledge</strong>. Only
                  when individual pieces fit to build a single coherent structure, will you be able to dramatically
                  reduce the learning time. This is closely related to the problem comprehension mentioned
                  in&nbsp;<strong>Rule 1: Do not learn if you do not understand</strong>. A single separated piece of
                  your picture is like a single German word in the textbook of history.Do not start from memorizing
                  loosely related facts! First read a chapter in your book that puts them together (e.g.&nbsp;<em>the
                    principles of the internal combustion engine</em>). Only then proceed with learning using individual
                  questions and answers (e.g.&nbsp;<em>What moves the pistons in the internal combustion engine?</em>),
                  etc.<br></li>
                <li><strong>Build upon the basics</strong><br>The picture of the learned whole (as discussed
                  in&nbsp;<strong>Rule 2: Learn before you memorize</strong>) does not have to be complete to the last
                  detail. Just the opposite, the simpler the picture the better. The shorter the initial chapter of your
                  book the better. Simple models are easier to comprehend and encompass. You can always build upon them
                  later on.Do not neglect the basics. Memorizing seemingly obvious things is not a waste of time! Basics
                  may also appear volatile and the cost of memorizing easy things is little. Better err on the safe
                  side. Remember that usually you spend 50% of your time repeating just 3-5% of the learned material!
                  Basics are usually easy to retain and take a microscopic proportion of your time. However, each memory
                  lapse on basics can cost you dearly!<br></li>
                <li><strong>Stick to the&nbsp;minimum information principle</strong><br>The material you learn must be
                  formulated in as simple way as it is<ul>
                    <li><strong>Simple is easy</strong><br>By definition, simple material is easy to remember. This
                      comes from the fact that its simplicity makes is easy for the brain to process it always in the
                      same way. Imagine a labyrinth. When making a repetition of a piece of material, your brain is
                      running through a labyrinth (you can view a neural network as a tangle of paths). While running
                      through the labyrinth, the brain leaves a track on the walls. If it can run in only one unique
                      way, the path is continuous and easy to follow. If there are many combinations, each run may leave
                      a different trace that will interfere with other traces making it difficult to find the exit. The
                      same happens on the cellular level with different synaptic connections being activated at each
                      repetition of complex material</li>
                    <li><strong>Repetitions of simple items are easier to schedule</strong><br>I assume you will make
                      repetitions of the learned material using optimum inter-repetition intervals (as in&nbsp;<a
                        href="https://www.supermemo.com">SuperMemo</a>). If you consider an item that is composed of two
                      sub-items, you will need to make repetitions that are frequent enough to keep the more difficult
                      item in memory. If you split the complex item into sub-items, each can be repeated at its own pace
                      saving your time. Very often, inexperienced students create items that could easily be split
                      into&nbsp;<strong>ten or more</strong>&nbsp;simpler sub-items! Although the number of items
                      increases, the number of repetitions of each item will usually be small enough to greatly outweigh
                      the cost of (1) forgetting the complex item again and again, (2) repeating it in excessively short
                      intervals or (3) actually remembering it only in part!</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>Here is a striking example:</p>

                  <tbody>
                    <tr>
                      <td><strong>Ill-formulated knowledge &#8211; Complex and wordy</strong></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td>Q: What are the characteristics of the Dead Sea?<br>A: Salt lake located on the border between
                        Israel and Jordan. Its shoreline is the lowest point on the Earth&#8217;s surface, averaging 396
                        m below sea level. It is 74 km long. It is seven times as salty (30% by volume) as the ocean.

                    </tr>

                </table>
              </figure>
              <p>You might want to experiment and try to learn two subjects using the two above approaches and see for
                yourself what advantage is brought by minimum information principle. This is particularly visible in the
                long perspective, i.e.&nbsp;<strong>the longer the time you need to remember knowledge, the more you
                  benefit from simplifying your items</strong>!</p>
              <p>Note in the example above how short the questions are. Note also that the answers are even shorter! We
                want a minimum amount of information to be retrieved from memory in a single repetition!&nbsp;<strong>We
                  want answer to be as short as imaginably possible</strong>!</p>
              <p>You will notice that the knowledge learned in the ill-structured example is not entirely equivalent to
                the well-structured formulation. For example, although you will remember why the Dead Sea can keep
                swimmers afloat, you may forget that it at all has such a characteristic in the first place!
                Additionally, rounding 396 to 400 and 74 to 70 produces some loss of information. These can be remedied
                by adding more questions or making the present ones more precise.</p>

                  deletion. It is a quick and effective method of converting textbook knowledge into knowledge that can
                  be subject to learning based on spaced repetition. Cloze deletion makes the core of the fast reading

                  <li><strong>Use imagery</strong><br>Visual cortex is that part of the brain in which visual stimuli
                    are
                    interpreted. It has been very well developed in the course of evolution and that is why we
                    say&nbsp;<em>one picture is worth a thousand words</em>. Indeed if you look at the number of details
                    kept in a picture and the easiness with which your memory can retain them, you will notice that our
                    verbal processing power is greatly inferior as compared with the visual processing power. The same
                    refers to memory. A graphic representation of information is usually far less volatile.Usually it
                    takes much less time to formulate a simple question-and-answer pair than to find or produce a neat
                    graphic image. This is why you will probably always have to weigh up cost and profits in using
                    graphics in your learning material. Well-employed images will greatly reduce your learning time in
                    areas such as anatomy, geography, geometry, chemistry, history, and many more.The power of imagery
                    explains why the concept of Tony Buzan&#8217;s mind maps is so popular. A mind map is an abstract
                    picture in which connections between its components reflect the logical connections between
                    individual
                    concepts.</li>

                  <li><strong>Use&nbsp;mnemonic techniques</strong><br>Mnemonic techniques are various techniques that
                    make remembering easier. They are often amazingly effective. For most students, a picture of a

                    very
                    surprising then to find out how easy it is to learn the techniques that make it possible with a dose
                    of training. These techniques are available to everyone and do not require any special skills!Before
                    you start believing that mastering such techniques will provide you with an eternal solution to the
                    problem of forgetting, be warned that the true bottleneck towards long-lasting and useful memories
                    is
                    not in quickly memorizing knowledge! This is indeed the easier part. The bottleneck lies in
                    retaining
                    memories for months, years or for lifetime! To accomplish the latter you will need&nbsp;<a

                    herein.There have been dozens of books written about mnemonic techniques. Probably those written by
                    Tony Buzan are most popular and respected. You can search the web for keywords such
                    as:&nbsp;<em>mind
                      maps, peg lists</em>,&nbsp;<em>mnemonic techniques</em>, etc.Experience shows that with a dose of
                    training you will need to consciously apply mnemonic techniques in only 1-5% of your items. With
                    time,
                    using mnemonic techniques will become automatic!<br>Exemplary mind map:</li>

                    used to formulate 10-20 items! Each item can ask about a specific subcomponent of the image. Graphic

                  <li><strong>Avoid sets</strong><br>A&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set"
                      rel="nofollow">set</a>&nbsp;is a collection of objects. For example, a set of fruits might be an
                    apple, a pear and a peach. A classic example of an item that is difficult to learn is an item that
                    asks for the list of the members of a set. For example:&nbsp;<em>What countries belong to the
                      European
                      Union?</em>&nbsp;You should avoid such items whenever possible due to the high cost of retaining
                    memories based on sets. If sets are absolutely necessary, you should always try to convert them
                    into&nbsp;enumerations. Enumerations are ordered lists of members (for example, the alphabetical
                    list
                    of the members of the EU). Enumerations are also hard to remember and should be avoided. However,
                    the
                    great advantage of enumerations over sets is that they are ordered and they force the brain to list
                    them always in the same order. An ordered list of countries contains more information than the set
                    of
                    countries that can be listed in any order. Paradoxically, despite containing more information,
                    enumerations are easier to remember. The reason for this has been discussed earlier in the context
                    of
                    the&nbsp;minimum information principle:&nbsp;<strong>you should always try to make sure your brain
                      works in the exactly same way at each repetition</strong>. In the case of sets, listing members in
                    varying order at each repetition has a disastrous effect on memory. It is nearly impossible to
                    memorize sets containing more than five members without the use of mnemonic techniques, enumeration,
                    grouping, etc. Despite this claim, you will often succeed due to subconsciously mastered techniques
                    that help you go around this problem. Those techniques, however, will fail you all too often. For
                    that
                    reason:&nbsp;<strong>Avoid sets!&nbsp;</strong>If you need them badly, convert them into
                    enumerations

                <p>Note that in the example above, we converted a 15-member set into 9 items, five of which are 2-3
                  member
                  sets, and one is a six member enumeration. Put it to your SuperMemo, and see how easy it is to
                  generate
                  the list of the European Union members using the historic timeline! Note the tricks used with France
                  and
                  the UK. They joined the union in the company of others but have been listed as separate items to
                  simplify the learning process. Note also that the sum of information included in this well-formulated
                  approach is far greater than that of the original set. Thus along simplicity, we gained some useful
                  knowledge. All individual items effectively comply with the&nbsp;minimum information principle! You
                  could go further by trying to split the Germany-Italy-Benelux set or using mnemonic techniques to
                  memorize the final seven-member enumeration (i.e. the last of the questions above). However, you
                  should
                  take those steps only if you have any problems with retaining the proposed set in memory.</p>

                  <li><strong>Avoid enumerations</strong><br>Enumerations are also an example of classic items that are
                    hard to learn. They are still far more acceptable than sets. Avoid enumerations wherever you can. If
                    you cannot avoid them, deal with them using&nbsp;cloze deletions&nbsp;(overlapping cloze deletions
                    if
                    possible). Learning the alphabet can be a good example of an overlapping cloze deletion:<br></li>

                <p>The above items will make learning the alphabet much faster. The greatest advantage of the above
                  approach is that is it easier for psychological reasons: the student does not have to stop repetitions
                  to recite the whole sequence and can only focus on a small part of the learned material. Still it is
                  recommended that he recite the whole alphabet&nbsp;<strong>after</strong>&nbsp;making the repetition.
                  However, once all individual pieces are well remembered, reciting the whole should be a pleasant and
                  speedy action that produces little frustration.<br>The cloze deletion used above is an overlapping
                  cloze
                  deletion, i.e. the same parts of the enumeration are strengthened in memory using different items (for
                  example, the sequence C-D will be needed to recall the second and the third item). This redundancy
                  does
                  not contradict the&nbsp;minimum information principle&nbsp;because&nbsp;<strong>the extra information
                    is
                    added in extra items</strong>.</p>
                <p>You can also deal with enumerations by using grouping like in the case of sets (see the&nbsp;European
                  Union example) but cloze deletions should be simpler and should suffice in most cases.<br>Learning
                  poems
                  is an example of learning enumerations (all words and sentences have to be uttered in a predefined
                  sequence); however, due to strong semantic connections, the rhyme and the rhythm, it may often be
                  possible to effectively remember poems without using cloze deletion and without the frustration of
                  forgetting small subcomponents again and again. However, once you notice you stumble with your poem,
                  you
                  should dismember it using cloze deletion and thus make sure that the learning is fast, easy, effective
                  and pleasurable<br></p>

                <p>Does it all sound artificial? It does! But you will never know how effective this approach is until

                  <li><strong>Combat&nbsp;interference</strong><br>When you learn about similar things you often confuse
                    them. For example, you may have problems distinguishing between the meanings of the words
                    <em>historic&nbsp;</em>and <em>historical</em>. This will even be more visible if you memorize lots
                    of
                    numbers, e.g. optimum dosages of drugs in pharmacotherapy. If knowledge of one item makes it harder
                    to
                    remember another item, we have a case of <strong>memory interference</strong>. You can often
                    remember
                    an item for years with straight excellent grades until &#8230; you memorize another item that makes
                    it
                    nearly impossible to remember either! For example, if you learn geography and you memorize that the
                    country located between Venezuela, Suriname and Brazil is Guyana, you are likely to easily recall
                    this
                    fact for years with just a couple of repetitions. However, once you add similar items asking about
                    the
                    location of all these countries, and French Guyana, and Colombia and more, you will suddenly notice
                    strong memory interference and you may experience unexpected forgetting. In simple terms: you will
                    get
                    confused about what is what.<br>Interference is probably the single greatest cause of forgetting in
                    collections of an experienced user of SuperMemo. You can never be sure when it strikes, and the only
                    hermetic procedure against it is to <strong>detect and eliminate</strong>. In other words, in many
                    cases it may be impossible to predict interference at the moment of formulating knowledge.
                    Interference can also occur between remotely related items like Guyana, Guyard and Guyenne, as well
                    as
                    Guyana, kayman and &#8230; aspirin. It may work differently for you and for your colleague. It very
                    hard to predict.Still you should do your best to prevent interference before it takes its toll. This
                    will make your learning process less stressful and mentally bearable. Here are some tips:<ul>
                      <li>make items as unambiguous as possible</li>
                      <li>stick to the&nbsp;minimum information principle&nbsp;(many of the remaining rules in this text
                        are based on avoiding interference!)</li>
                      <li>eliminate interference as soon as you spot it, i.e. before it becomes your obsession (e.g. as
                        soon as you see the word&nbsp;<strong><em>inept</em></strong>&nbsp;you think &#8220;<em>I know
                          the
                          meanings of&nbsp;<strong>inept</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>inapt</strong>&nbsp;but I will
                          never know which is which!&#8221;</em>)</li>

                  <li><strong>Optimize wording</strong><br>The wording of your items must be optimized to make sure that
                    in minimum time the right bulb in your brain lights up. This will reduce error rates, increase
                    specificity, reduce response time, and help your concentration.<strong>Less optimum item: cloze

                    better context, simplify wording, and reduce interference. In the example below, using the words
                    <em>humble</em> and <em>supplicant</em> helps the student focus on the word <em>shamelessly</em> and
                    thus strengthen the correct semantics. Better focus helps eliminating interference. Secondly, the

                  examples are very resistant to&nbsp;interference&nbsp;and can greatly reduce your learning time</p>
                <ol start="15">
                  <li><strong>Rely on emotional states</strong><br>If you can illustrate your items with examples that
                    are
                    vivid or even shocking, you are likely to enhance retrieval (as long as you do not overuse same
                    tools
                    and fall victim of interference!). Your items may assume bizarre form; however, as long as they are
                    produced for your private consumption, the end justifies the means. Use objects that evoke very
                    specific and strong emotions: love, sex, war, your late relative, object of your infatuation, Linda
                    Tripp, Nelson Mandela, etc. It is well known that emotional states can facilitate recall; however,
                    you
                    should make sure that you are not deprived of the said emotional clues at the moment when you need
                    to
                    retrieve a given memory in a real-life situation</li>

                <p><br>If you have vivid and positive memories related to the meetings between Nelson Mandela and F.W.
                  de
                  Klerk, you are likely to quickly grasp the meaning of the definition of banter. Without the example
                  you
                  might struggle with interference from words such as&nbsp;<em>badinage&nbsp;</em>or
                  even&nbsp;<em>chat</em>. There is no risk of irrelevant emotional state in this example as the state
                  helps to define the semantics of the learned concept! A well-thought example can often reduce your
                  learning time several times! I have recorded examples in which an item without an example was
                  forgotten
                  20 times within one year, while the same item with a subtle interference-busting example was not
                  forgotten even once in ten repetitions spread over five years. This is roughly equivalent
                  to&nbsp;<strong>25-fold saving in time in the period of 20 years</strong>! Such examples are not rare!
                  They are most effectively handled with the all the preceding rules targeted
                  on&nbsp;simplicity&nbsp;and
                  against the&nbsp;interference</p>
                <ol start="16">
                  <li><strong>Context cues&nbsp;simplify wording</strong><br>You can use&nbsp;categories&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a
                      href="https://www.supermemo.com/en">SuperMemo 2000/2002</a>, provide different branches of
                    knowledge
                    with a different look (different&nbsp;template), use reference labels (<em>Title, Author,
                      Date,</em>&nbsp;etc.) and clearly label subcategories (e.g. with strings such
                    as&nbsp;<em>chem</em>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<em>chemistry</em>,&nbsp;<em>math</em>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<em>mathematics</em>,
                    etc.). This will help you simplify the wording of your items as you will be relieved from the need
                    to
                    specify the context of your question. In the example below, the well-defined
                    prefix&nbsp;<em>bioch:&nbsp;</em>saves you a lot of typing and a lot of reading while still making
                    sure you do not confuse the abbreviation GRE with Graduate Record Examination. Note that in the
                    recommended case, you process the item starting from the label&nbsp;<em>bioch</em>&nbsp;which puts
                    your brain immediately in the right context. While processing the lesser optimum case, you will
                    waste
                    precious milliseconds on flashing the standard meaning of GRE and &#8230; what is worse &#8230; you
                    will light up the wrong areas of your brain that will now perhaps be prone to interference!<br></li>

                  <li><strong>Redundancy&nbsp;does not contradict minimum information
                      principle</strong><br><strong>Redundancy</strong> in simple terms is more information than needed
                    or
                    duplicate information, etc. Redundancy does not have to contradict the minimum information principle
                    and may even be welcome. The problem of redundancy is too wide for this short text. Here are some
                    examples that are only to illustrate that <em>minimum information principle</em> cannot be
                    understood
                    as <em>minimum number of characters or bits in your collections or even items</em>:<ul>
                      <li><strong>passive and active approach</strong>: if you learn a foreign language, e.g. Esperanto,
                        you will often build word pairs such as&nbsp;<em>phone-telefono, language-lingvo,
                          hope-esperanto,&nbsp;</em>etc. These pairs require active recall of the foreign word. Active
                        recall does not, however, guarantee passive recognition and you may fail
                        with&nbsp;<em>telefono-phone,
                          lingvo-language,&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>esperanto-hope.&nbsp;</em>Adding new elements with
                        swapped questions and answers may in some cases be redundant but it does not contradict the
                        minimum information principle! Your items are still as simple as possible. You just get more of
                        themIn&nbsp;<a href="https://www.supermemo.com/en">SuperMemo 2000/2002</a>, you can quickly
                        generate swapped word-pair items with&nbsp;<strong>Duplicate&nbsp;</strong>(<em>Ctrl+Alt+D</em>)
                        and&nbsp;<strong>Swap&nbsp;</strong><em>(Ctrl+Shift+S)</em></li>
                      <li><strong>reasoning cues</strong>: you will often want to boost your reasoning ability by asking
                        about a solution to the problem. Instead of just&nbsp;<em>memorizing</em>&nbsp;the answer you
                        would like to quickly follow the reasoning steps (e.g. solve a simple mathematical equation)
                        and&nbsp;<em>generate</em>&nbsp;the answer. In such a case, providing the hint on the reasoning
                        steps in the answer will only serve helping you always follow the right path at repetitions</li>
                      <li><strong>derivation steps</strong>: in more complex problems to solve, memorizing individual
                        derivation steps is always highly recommended (e.g. solving complex mathematical problems). It
                        is
                        not cramming! It is making sure that the brain can always follow the fastest path while solving
                        the problem. For more on boosting creativity and intelligence read:&nbsp;Roots of genius and
                        creativity, as well as more specific:&nbsp;Derivation, reasoning and intelligence</li>
                      <li><strong>multiple semantic representation</strong>: very often the same knowledge can be
                        represented and viewed from different angles. Memorizing different representations of the same
                        fact or rule is recommended in cases where a given memory is of high value. This will increase
                        the
                        expected recall rate (beyond that specified with the&nbsp;forgetting index)!</li>
                      <li><strong>flexible repetition</strong>: if there are many valid responses to the same question
                        make sure that your representation makes it possible to identify the equivalence and reward you
                        with good grades by providing just one of the equivalent choices. For example, if you learn a
                        language, it rarely make sense to learn all synonyms that meet a definition of a concept. It is
                        more adequate to consider a single synonym as the sufficient answer (e.g.&nbsp;<em>a mark made
                          by
                          ink spilt on sth</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em>blot/blob/blotch</em>)</li>
                      <li>more</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Provide&nbsp;sources</strong><br>Except for well-tested and proven knowledge (such
                    as&nbsp;<em>2+2=4</em>), it is highly recommended that you include sources from which you have
                    gathered your knowledge. In real-life situation you will often be confronted with challenges to your
                    knowledge. Sources can come to your rescue. You will also find that facts and figures differ
                    depending
                    on the source. You can really be surprised how frivolously reputable information agencies publish
                    figures that are drastically different from other equally reputable sources. Without SuperMemo,
                    those
                    discrepancies are often difficult to notice: before you encounter the new fact, the old one is often
                    long forgotten. With sources provided, you will be able to make more educated choices on which
                    pieces
                    of information are more reliable. Adding reliability labels may also be helpful (e.g.&nbsp;<em>Watch
                      out!, Other sources differ!</em>, etc.). Sources should accompany your items but should not be
                    part
                    of the learned knowledge (unless it is critical for you to be able to recall the source whenever
                    asked).</li>
                  <li><strong>Provide&nbsp;date stamping</strong><br>Knowledge can be relatively stable (basic math,
                    anatomy, taxonomy, physical geography, etc.) and highly volatile (economic indicators, high-tech
                    knowledge, personal statistics, etc.). It is important that you provide your items with time
                    stamping
                    or other tags indicating the degree of obsolescence. In case of statistical figures, you might stamp
                    them with the year they have been collected. When learning software applications, it is enough you
                    stamp the item with the software version. Once you have newer figures you can update your items.
                    Unfortunately, in most cases you will have to re-memorize knowledge that became outdated. Date
                    stamping is useful in editing and verifying your knowledge; however, you will rarely want to
                    memorize
                    stamping itself. If you would like to remember the changes of a given figure in time (e.g. GNP
                    figures
                    over a number of years), the date stamping becomes the learned knowledge itself.</li>
                  <li><strong>Prioritize</strong><br>You will always face far more knowledge that you will be able to
                    master. That is why prioritizing is critical for building quality knowledge in the long-term. The
                    way
                    you prioritize will affect the way your knowledge slots in. This will also affect the speed of
                    learning (e.g. see: learn basics first). There are many stages at which prioritizing will take
                    place;
                    only few are relevant to knowledge representation, but all are important:<ol>
                      <li><strong>Prioritizing sources&nbsp;</strong>&#8211; there will always be a number of sources of
                        your knowledge. If you are still at student years: these will most likely be books and notes
                        pertaining to different subjects. Otherwise you will probably rely more on journals, Internet,
                        TV,
                        newspapers, encyclopedias, dictionaries, etc. It is always worth being aware what is the optimum
                        proportion of time devoted to those varied sources. As you progress with learning, you will
                        quickly develop a good sense of which learning slots bring better results and which might be
                        extended at the cost of others</li>
                      <li><strong>Extracting knowledge&nbsp;</strong>&#8211; unless you are about to pass an important
                        exam, it nearly never makes sense to memorize whole books or whole articles. You will need to
                        extract those parts that are most likely to impact the quality of your knowledge. You can do it
                        by
                        (1) marking paragraphs in a book or journal, (2) pasting relevant web pages to SuperMemo, (3)
                        pasting relevant passages to SuperMemo, (4) typing facts and figures directly to SuperMemo
                        notes,
                        etc. You will need some experience before you can accurately measure how much knowledge you can
                        indeed transfer to your brain and what degree of detail you can feasibly master. Your best way
                        to
                        prioritize the flow of knowledge into your memory is to use&nbsp;incremental reading&nbsp;tools
                      </li>
                      <li><strong>Transferring knowledge to SuperMemo&nbsp;</strong>&#8211; you may try to stick with
                        the
                        20 rules of formulating knowledge at the moment of introducing your material to SuperMemo.
                        However, you can also literally transfer your notes or import whole files and later use the
                        mechanisms provided by SuperMemo to determine the order of processing the imported material.
                        Probably the best criterion for choosing between formulating or just importing is the time
                        needed
                        for accurately formulating the item or items. If formulation requires more knowledge, more time,
                        comparing with other sources, etc. you can just import. Otherwise, if you believe that
                        formulating
                        an accurate item is a matter of seconds, formulate it</li>
                      <li><strong>Formulating items&nbsp;</strong>&#8211; make sure that explanatory or optional
                        components of the answer are placed in the parentheses so that your attention is focused on the
                        most important part of the item. The parts in the parentheses can be read after the repetition
                        to
                        strengthen the memory in its context</li>
                      <li><strong>Using forgetting index&nbsp;</strong>&#8211; you can use the&nbsp;forgetting
                        index&nbsp;to prioritize pending items. The sequence of repetitions will naturally be determined
                        by SuperMemo; however, you can request higher retention level for items that are more important
                        and lower retention level for items of lower priority</li>
                      <li><strong>Learning&nbsp;</strong>&#8211; the process of prioritizing does not end with the onset
                        of repetitions. Here are the tools you can use to continue setting your priorities while the
                        learning process is under way:<ol>
                          <li><strong>Remember&nbsp;</strong>(<em>Ctrl+M</em>) &#8211; re-memorize items of high
                            priority
                            that have changed or which are extremely important to your knowledge at a given moment. If
                            you
                            choose&nbsp;<em>Ctrl+M&nbsp;</em>you will be able to determine the next interval for the
                            currently reviewed item (its repetition counter will be reset to zero). It is recommended
                            that
                            you always re-memorize items whose content has changed significantly</li>
                          <li><strong>Reschedule&nbsp;</strong>(<em>Ctrl+J</em>) &#8211; manually schedule the date of
                            the
                            next repetition</li>
                          <li><strong>Execute repetition</strong>&nbsp;(<em>Ctrl+Shift+R</em>) &#8211; manually execute
                            a
                            repetition even before the repetition&#8217;s due date (e.g. when reviewing particularly
                            important material)</li>
                          <li><strong>Forget</strong>&nbsp;(<em>Ctrl+R</em>)<em>&nbsp;</em>&#8211; remove the current
                            item
                            from the learning process and place it at the end of the&nbsp;pending queue</li>
                          <li><strong>Dismiss&nbsp;</strong>(<em>Ctrl+D</em>)<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&#8211; ignore the
                            current item in the learning process altogether</li>
                          <li><strong>Delete&nbsp;</strong>(<em>Ctrl+Shift+Del</em>) &#8211; remove the current item
                            from
                            your collection</li>
                          <li>Change the forgetting index of memorized items or change the ordinal of pending items
                            (<em>Ctrl+Shift+P</em>)</li>
                        </ol>
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
                <p>Here again are the twenty rules of formulating knowledge. You will notice that the first 16 rules
                  revolve around making memories simple! Some of the rules strongly overlap. For example: do not learn
                  if
                  you do not understand is a form of applying the minimum information principle which again is a way of
                  making things simple:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>Do not learn if you do not understand</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>Learn before you memorize&nbsp;</strong>&#8211; build the picture of the whole before you
                    dismember it into simple items in SuperMemo. If the whole shows holes, review it again!</li>
                  <li><strong>Build upon the basics&nbsp;</strong>&#8211; never jump both feet into a complex manual
                    because you may never see the end. Well remembered basics will help the remaining knowledge easily
                    fit
                    in</li>
                  <li><strong>Stick to the minimum information principle</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; if you continue
                    forgetting
                    an item, try to make it as simple as possible. If it does not help, see the remaining rules (cloze
                    deletion, graphics, mnemonic techniques, converting sets into enumerations, etc.)</li>
                  <li><strong>Cloze deletion is easy and effective&nbsp;</strong>&#8211; completing a deleted word or
                    phrase is not only an effective way of learning. Most of all, it greatly speeds up formulating
                    knowledge and is highly recommended for beginners</li>
                  <li><strong>Use imagery&nbsp;</strong>&#8211; a picture is worth a thousand words</li>
                  <li><strong>Use mnemonic techniques&nbsp;</strong>&#8211; read about peg lists and mind maps. Study
                    the
                    books by Tony Buzan. Learn how to convert memories into funny pictures. You won&#8217;t have
                    problems
                    with phone numbers and complex figures</li>
                  <li><strong>Graphic deletion is as good as cloze deletion&nbsp;</strong>&#8211; obstructing parts of a
                    picture is great for learning anatomy, geography and more</li>
                  <li><strong>Avoid sets&nbsp;</strong>&#8211; larger sets are virtually un-memorizable unless you
                    convert
                    them into enumerations!</li>
                  <li><strong>Avoid enumerations&nbsp;</strong>&#8211; enumerations are also hard to remember but can be
                    dealt with using cloze deletion</li>
                  <li><strong>Combat interference&nbsp;</strong>&#8211; even the simplest items can be completely
                    intractable if they are similar to other items. Use examples, context cues, vivid illustrations,
                    refer
                    to emotions, and to your personal life</li>
                  <li><strong>Optimize wording&nbsp;</strong>&#8211; like you reduce mathematical equations, you can
                    reduce complex sentences into smart, compact and enjoyable maxims</li>
                  <li><strong>Refer to other memories&nbsp;</strong>&#8211; building memories on other memories
                    generates
                    a coherent and hermetic structure that forgetting is less likely to affect. Build upon the basics
                    and
                    use planned redundancy to fill in the gaps</li>
                  <li><strong>Personalize and provide examples&nbsp;</strong>&#8211; personalization might be the most
                    effective way of building upon other memories. Your personal life is a gold mine of facts and events
                    to refer to. As long as you build a collection for yourself, use personalization richly to build
                    upon
                    well established memories</li>
                  <li><strong>Rely on emotional states&nbsp;</strong>&#8211; emotions are related to memories. If you
                    learn a fact in the sate of sadness, you are more likely to recall it if when you are sad. Some
                    memories can induce emotions and help you employ this property of the brain in remembering</li>
                  <li><strong>Context cues simplify wording&nbsp;</strong>&#8211; providing context is a way of
                    simplifying memories, building upon earlier knowledge and avoiding interference</li>
                  <li><strong>Redundancy does not contradict minimum information principle&nbsp;</strong>&#8211; some
                    forms of redundancy are welcome. There is little harm in memorizing the same fact as viewed from
                    different angles. Passive and active approach is particularly practicable in learning word-pairs.
                    Memorizing derivation steps in problem solving is a way towards boosting your intellectual powers!
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Provide sources&nbsp;</strong>&#8211; sources help you manage the learning process,
                    updating
                    your knowledge, judging its reliability, or importance</li>
                  <li><strong>Provide date stamping&nbsp;</strong>&#8211; time stamping is useful for volatile knowledge
                    that changes in time</li>
                  <li><strong>Prioritize</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; effective learning is all about prioritizing.
                    In&nbsp;<em>incremental&nbsp;reading</em>&nbsp;you can start from badly formulated knowledge and
                    improve its shape as you proceed with learning (in proportion to the cost of inappropriate
                    formulation). If need be, you can review pieces of knowledge again, split it into parts,
                    reformulate,
                    reprioritize, or delete. See also:&nbsp;Incremental reading,&nbsp;Devouring knowledge,&nbsp;Flow of
